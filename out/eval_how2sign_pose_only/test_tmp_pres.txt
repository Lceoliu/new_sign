sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_10-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: If you want to put a little bit more bleach color, you can almost spray right on the skin to give you a clear insight.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_11-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Because this is a basic shimmer color, we want to come up with a natural shine on the skin.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_12-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Once you've done that base, you're going to go ahead and take a crease in the eye area.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_13-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The shade of onion we're going to choose is called a cashmere.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_14-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: This is a basic cage with a couple of purples and a five goldens, and her eyes, I actually have a little gold, and that gold will actually come up in my eye.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_15-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can see the shape where you can see the crease is just a little underneath and you want to go ahead and put the crease in very clearly and that will give the eye look a little brighter.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_16_17-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: What I'm going to show you is a little bit of a technique called C. I've been looking for a little bit of a lighter X crease and a little more of a lighter
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_18-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We want to take the color, go ahead and close the creases and we want to kind of go all the way around the ear canal, and then we're going to go all the way around the ear canal
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_19-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: When I close my eye, I can see that it's going to help my eye look a little bit more shadowed.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_2-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Once you've got a client's eye on you, you can imagine what kind of height they're going to be talking about.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_20-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Watch our next segment about natural beauty products.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_3-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Another tip when selecting a color for a crease is to actually look at the color of the eye.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_4-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: They've got pretty green eyes, and you can look at a lot of these lines that are purple.
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_5-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's going to help anything that comes up with the greens more. So what we're going to do is we're going to use a color that's a little bit of a purple
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_6-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The first thing we're going to do is paint the ear tone and we're going to find the basic colors that we're going to have and we're going to do a little bit more drama on the client today, but
sample: G1lNlhjWC1I_7-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We're going to start on the makeup and pick some moisture foundation for your crease.

sample: G23G21G49dk_2-2-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And for instance one of the ones I used to use earlier, I showed you my foil on the Bailey tank, it's just a basic oil.
sample: G23G21G49dk_3-2-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: To start at the end of the rope, you're going to start at the end of the rope and you're going to start at the end of the rope and you're going to start at the
sample: G23G21G49dk_4-2-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can start out if you want.
sample: G23G21G49dk_5-2-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So you don't want to do this rope, it's really important because again, breaking the fabric, that twists the rope, that's not good.

sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_1-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: That's how you start your session.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_10-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So what you can do is you can show them patterns on the create by chooseing a new one.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_11-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So as we do it, it's going to learn to maintain this moment that it will change any of the patterns of each of the players.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_12-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And each pattern has six six, no, there's eight different symbols that I play in different presents.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_13-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can unchange any type of thing, you can do a bunch of different things.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_14-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: These are very power, they hold a lot of different sounders.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_15-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can use as many of these  drums within your hoop window.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_16-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I'm going to go on my stripper, and I'm going to in play, and you can just go to each one and hear a different press.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_2-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You want to go to ceiling, open.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_3-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You're going to compromise, you're going to hip-op, you're going to hit-op.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_4-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Once this is obvious, you can create and store any kind of data that you want.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_5-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: After you save, what I'm going to do is show that just how to change, what I'm going to try to do.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_6-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So, now we're going to look at the ultrabeat.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_7-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I'm going to load it up on the duct which is going to hold it in place.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_8-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: That's the term machine that holds all clips in place.
sample: G3gm_C5UueQ_9-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Now, what I can do now is monitor it within a threshold.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_0-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Dr. Joe Neely.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_1-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I practice with the Barton Oaks Dental Group.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_10-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's kind of like moving the nose where it needs to be, and then holding it there for a while.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_11-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's not part of it.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_12-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So we're going to take it, move it around, and then you just simply wipe it off.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_13-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: That makes the tooth very medium for the tissues and so often it's very loose.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_14-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The second part of it could put pressure on the tissue and it could ride against the tissue and deep down into the tissue hole and cause it to slide back and forth.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_15-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Another problem with that is to visually see them, a demo is a etched invisible to some people, so I'm going to have something that doesn't show.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_2-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We're going to talk about the problem with the parting.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_3-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The most common with a parting glass is that it is too close and moveable.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_4-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Some of these are very natural they can't actually breed because it depends on the tissue which is its own molecule to support or that's just around the porcelain.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_5-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: They have to be able to be eliminated and so they can only be so secure.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_6-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Usually, if you're partially thin, that's getting enough that you can't dial it, it's going to delay it, and then it's going to be a good
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_7-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Once the part is tight enough, it also has to be filled with CD.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_8-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: If the part of the tooth is held up by the part in the portion of the tooth, it doesn't allow the part to be dedicated against the tissue.
sample: G3k86AVFwVs_9-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We're going to put pressure on the tooth and act like at Orchid Classic.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_0-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Hi this is Dan Schmidt from the Chinese Martial Arts Center and in this clip we're going to show you defense against a forward knife throw.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_1-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So if someone is approaching you with a back knife and they're flipping you straight.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_2-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We're going to catch that attack, take it out of the way so that we're going to step forward straight.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_3-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It starts turning so you don't want to keep it here and then it affects your body.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_4-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's a very physical swing, and it's allowed to go.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_5-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You know it's going to be a circle around the head, a circle around the head, a circle around the head, and a circle around the head.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_6-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Okay, practicing again, you can press the fingers a little bit and point towards twisting at the bottom straight.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_7-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Then they're going to move out of the way and they're going to lock it up into the back.
sample: G3qZW-hZXaQ_8-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: This is proper self defense for the knife.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_0-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Once you've got it on, you want to push yourself on the ground, push yourself down.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_0-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And once you're comfortable with your heel side, two feet, up on your heel side.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_1-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I'm going to show you now how to learn how to turn.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_1-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You want to learn how to do your toe side.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_10-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So, as you can see, I'm going to press down on my lower body right here and I'm going to press down on my lower body and I'm going to press down on my knee.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_10-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: When you can take a look, when I stand on the toes, I'm going to move my weight in place forward and my knees are going to bend.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_11-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's going to come out like this.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_11-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Your boots in this case can be very expensive.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_12-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Then she's going to bring her hands up to the crown of her head.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_12-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We're going to push against your shin, holding your weight here.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_13-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You're looking up to the sky, and you're looking down to the sky.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_13-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: To increase balance on your toe side you're going to center your shoulders by shoulder width apart, back to where you're coming from.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_14-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And you're going to lower your heart, and you're going to lower your back, and you're going to lower your shoulders, and you're going to lower your shoulders.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_14-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I'm going to start in center and I'm going to feel really relaxed in this position, hip sliding forward, knees sliding back brown, go ahead and let it go down.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_15-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You're going to push down.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_15-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Keep the rat in place up.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_16-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You're going to dribble to the bottom and stop, and then you're going to push, and then you're going to dribble towards the bottom, and you're going to
sample: G42xKICVj9U_16-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: If you want to stop, just push forward just a little bit.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_17-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And that's how you step on your toe.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_17-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And that's how you stand on toes.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_18-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And that's how you keep your feet on the ground.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_18-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So, as long as you keep weight forward and watch the hill, you're going to be able to do it.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_19-10-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Don't let them go out to the side and go out to the other side.
sample: G42xKICVj9U_19-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: But let's take a look at that.

sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_1-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I'm Jim Dowd with Zoar Outdoor.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_10-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Notice that I did something else as I move the fly rod after I've created my speed up and stop.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_10-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You'll notice I did something else when I move on to the fly route when I gain speed.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_11-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You do the relationships by stopping it.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_11-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The next thing we're going to do is touch the cast by stopping it.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_12-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The other thing I did was a little bit out of the wire out.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_12-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The other thing I did was just take a little bit of line around the pot.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_13-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: If I make the racket like this, it pulls back and makes my joint cast stop and I released a line slip out of it.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_13-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: If I make an empty hinge like this, it's going to put it onto the fly, and I'm going to pull the clay out of the way so I don't pull the clay out of
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_14-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Watch my fingers as I do this.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_14-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Watch my fingers, that's going.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_15-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: That's the right stroke in the front.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_15-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Two lines here, right underneath me, in front of me.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_16-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: See how it's slipping through the glide?
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_16-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: See how it goes through your guides.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_17-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: That allows the fly to go straight and to land specifically on the goal and that's jacking the fly line from draging the fly.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_17-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We're going to make a straight line where it's a straight line and we're going to take care of that extra line to keep it from coming off the line.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_18-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The contact lens is the tool to catch in.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_18-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Touching the toe is a useful tool.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_3-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: When you're a fly fisher, you need to move your fly line and strike through the line in a place that allows the flight of the drag into a way that allows you to run or the bass or your game
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_3-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Sometimes where really fly spray should be thrown in your fly airplane flight or travel through air, in a place that allows it to fly to the shore in a way that doesn't notice
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_4-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: One of the easiest, one of the easiest, and one of the easiest, and across the bass to one that's called the tch cast.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_4-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: One of the easiest and easiest side strokes and over strokes is called the ranch cases.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_5-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The relative to the dot simply means you're making your forward cast, just as the line is unfurling, you connect it to the side.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_5-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: When you reach for the touch cast, it's simply going to go forward cast, and when the line goes out, you're going to cross and you're going to hit the touch cast.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_6-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I'm going to extend it.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_6-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Oh, I'm going to save it.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_7-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: One is a left handed tractor, making the tactical tractor and turning.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_7-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We're going to put our left wing and our cast to make a cast and then we're going to go to the left and we're going to go to the left.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_8-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: When it allows you to put on a fly line it won't pull on a line and then move your fingers fly in a way that's not natural.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_8-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: What that does is it allows you to put a fly line in it, it won't hold on to the line and then move to your fly in a way that doesn't look natural.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_9-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The spine can be done both on the left and across your body on the right side.
sample: fzDHRCKr7wU_9-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can either lay your left hand over, or you can throw it over your body right there.
sample: fzNnTgHa1lM_0-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So for double stop work in the third we go to G and D, and again you would really see here that your first finger is really like acting as a anchor and it is play both notes at the same
sample: fzNnTgHa1lM_1-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And the other great thing about practicing this particular double stop is that you can tune both the notes.
sample: fzNnTgHa1lM_2-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So now we're going to do the low G, and the D with the low D, with the double portion with these specific, we have choices.
sample: fzNnTgHa1lM_3-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Okay, now we're going to tune from the bottom and we're going to go to your open G string with the G string with the D and you can toe from the top test, open G string with the
sample: fzNnTgHa1lM_4-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Either way you're going to be in tune and again you can practice your out serves.
sample: fzNnTgHa1lM_5-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's going to help you pound in a stroke for the G and D.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_0-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: In this clip we're going to identify the proper handkerchiefs to throw a snow ball.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_0-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: In this clip, we're going to identify the proper hand gloves when holding the snow ball.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_1-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: For proper hand washing, I've got different things that you can wear for winter and jets still have built snow balls.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_1-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And for the right hand side, there's a lot of different things that you can get in there for the winter, to build a snow ball.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_10-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: They keep your fingers forward and it's good for a lot of action.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_10-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Keeping or waiting for a lot of action.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_11-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: For a snow ball, you don't have much control of using it.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_11-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: When you're using a snow ball, you can actually break it up and make it, but you don't have to have a lot of control about it when you're making it.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_12-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And it's not easy to make a good ball and throw a little bit hiking, but you could longer wear those type of gloves rather than using regular gloves.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_12-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's not easy to make a good loop, it's a little harsh, but it's probably going to last longer than certain types of worms.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_13-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: But again, the  control is just there, when you throw it.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_13-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Again, control is not there when you throw.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_14-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: This could be your first choice for a good tactic of boxing.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_14-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's not your first choice for a good storm fighting.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_15-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: There are a cotton polymer blend of cloth and it's very good for making a snow ball.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_15-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: This is a standard polymer mixed version of a cloth which is good for building snow blocks.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_16-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can build a snowman just fine, but they're not really waterproof and you probably want to be able to add something to keep your hands dry, yes warm.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_16-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You could put a bunch of things on there, but this is not water protection, because you might want to add something that's going to keep your hands dry and it's warm.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_17-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: They're standardly used by people that want to be able to use their fingers and at the same time stay warm.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_17-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Also gloves are most commonly used by people who want to keep their fingers still, somewhat dry.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_18-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: This is a very good warm-up that you're going to give you a good control.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_18-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's not very warm, but it gives you a good control.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_19-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So you could make a good throw ball, it's a very tight ball, it's a degreator, and you could throw it out.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_19-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can use a really good snow wool fencing, it's a very round, very clay fencing and throw.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_2-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I've got a leather medium.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_2-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We've got some fabric blends here.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_20-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's almost like using your hand but again it's very warm and it's probably a good choice because they can get very wet and quick and they're not going
sample: fzOH00UZg84_20-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Again, use your hands, but again, that's not so good, but it's probably not a good choice because maybe it's just going to get wet and then they're not
sample: fzOH00UZg84_21-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: These gloves are really a good tool glove to make the snow.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_21-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: These gloves are a very good glove for a throw ball.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_22-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's kind of yogurt.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_22-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Different kinds of warms.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_23-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It still has control.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_23-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: They're like controlled.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_24-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can use your fingers and you can build a snowy ball.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_24-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can use your fingers, you can build good chords.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_25-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can smash it well, use it all for your fingers and your hands will stay warm.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_25-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can put it in a blender and use all your fingers and your hands, they stay in a very good condition.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_26-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It might be on the drain when it's gone, especially if it's gone, but it's going to be certain on that water proof protection, and those will also benefit for keeping
sample: fzOH00UZg84_26-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: They might melt later, if they're melted but in certain gloves and water protection, and these will help keep their hands dry and whatever's the best to choose.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_27-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Also, you're probably going to use a bare hand for a snow ball.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_27-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Also you're probably going to be able to use a blank hand for snow fighting.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_28-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Usually the noise is okay, fighting and you might find a snow and a clay that you can generally have a good time but not going to continue because it gets cold.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_28-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Usually when you're not going to have gloves on, if you don't have gloves on, it's going to be a really fun time, but it's not going to be
sample: fzOH00UZg84_29-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: But bare handed hand could be the most accurate way to throw in the snow ball for sure.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_29-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: The hands in the middle are the most common ways to create snow balls.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_3-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You have a wall lid, which is probably the warmth of hand that you can get.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_3-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You can see we've got an article that says maybe warmth of all the gloves that we can get.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_30-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I'm going to grab it and I'm going to make it a better smooth snow ball, and it really changes from my dryer once that's the most accurate way to go real.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_30-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I'm going to show you how to pick the right ones, and you can go ahead and rub them in a little bit more accurately, and throw them once that's the most accurate way to
sample: fzOH00UZg84_31-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: And those will also benefit for keeping your hands dry and warm.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_31-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: If you need to have that warmth on your lips, it's going to get a little chilly.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_4-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: I've got some really light arms, really thin.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_4-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Some of the gloves are very, very fine.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_5-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It has more medium coverage that's kind of like a tuxedo type.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_5-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We have some medium gloves, like driving type gloves, these are very good.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_6-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: Gloves are very good, I have some cloth and this is more of a cloth type of glove.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_6-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: We've got some cloth here that's a little more like a cloth that's a little bit more conventional and we're going to use it as a standard cloth.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_7-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: This is a wall.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_7-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: That's the wall.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_8-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's like a medium glove.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_8-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's like a planet and a straight glove.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_9-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: These samples are really warm.
sample: fzOH00UZg84_9-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: These bottles are very, very warm.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_0-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So you have some good techniques.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_0-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: That's always a good technique.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_1-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: How do we move in belly dancing?
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_1-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: How do you move your belly dancing?
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_10-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: They're going to pull up a little bit tighter than the side muscles.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_10-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: That's a nice rule to add on the hip lift.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_11-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's important as you do this to make sure that your belly is lower to the side.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_11-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: It's important to do that making sure that your belly stays tight to the side.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_12-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: So don't let your back lean up.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_12-8-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: This is going to hold it in place and it's not going to go back.
sample: fzQ2E3_xBZA_13-5-rgb_front.mp4, prediction: You want to make sure that you get the right turn and the right touch.
